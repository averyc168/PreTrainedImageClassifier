## Pre-Trained Model For Image Classification of Dog Breeds

An image classification model was built using PyTorch to take in a directory of images and classifies them to 
see if they are dogs or not, and if so, what kind of dog breed it is. The three different models that are used 
for image classification are ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG. You can find the stats of how accurate it is based on if
it correctly identified if the image is a dog, and if the dog breed is correct, and the classifications of every
image in the "pet_images/" directory. The Python code is ran on command line, look at "run_models_batch.sh" for
an example of how to run it.
